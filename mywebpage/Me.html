            <p>Hi! I'm <span>Ayomitide OAJ</span>. I am a developer with a serious passion for teaching. I've spent the last few years teaching people to program at 3 different immersive bootcamps where I've helped hundreds of people to become developers.My graduates works at Google, Salesforce and so on.</p><br> After graduating from my class, 90% of my students went on to receive full-time developer roles. I also worked at Udacity as a <span> Senior Course developer </span>on the web development team where I go to reach thousands of students daily.<br> I've since focused my time on bringing classroom teaching experience  to an online environment. I've spent couple of years figuring out the "formula" to teaching technical skills in a classroom environment, and I'm really excited to finally share my experties with you. I can confidently say that my online courses are without a doubt the most comprehensive ones on market.<br>
                        
        <span><p style = font-size:22px;text-align:center>Join me on this exciting Adventure!</p></span>
