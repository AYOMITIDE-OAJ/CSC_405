        Today Web Development is software engineering. By participating in the<span> OAJ Web Development program </span> you’ll gain the skills of a front-end developer; building the code that runs in the web browser. Starting with HTML and adding CSS you’ll make the page look and by learning to use JavaScript you’ll complete the user experience on the web page. We then add the back-end skills that include database access, API integration, the ability to use frameworks and code testing to give our students the ability to graduate as productive full stack developers

    Hi! Welcome to the Web Developer Bootcamp, the<span> only course you need to learn web development.</span>There are lot of options for online developer training, but this is without a doubt the most comprehensive and effective on the market. Here's why:<br>
    <ul>
    <li>This is the only online course taught by a professional bootcamp instructor</li><br>
        <li><span>85% of my in-person bootcamp students go on to get full-time developer jobs.</span> Most of them are complete beginners when I started working with them. </li><br>
        <li>This is the only complete beginner full-stack developer course that covers NodeJS.</li><br>
        <li>We build 15+ projects, including a <span> gigantic production application called YelpCamp.</span> No other course walks you through the creation of such a substantial application.</li><br>
        <li>The course is <span>constantly updated</span> with new content, projects, and modules. Think of it as a subscription to a never-ending supply of developer training.</li>
        <p>When you're learning to program you often have to sacrifice learning the exciting and current technologies in favor of the "beginner friendly" classes. With this course, you get the best of both worlds. This is a course designed for the complete beginner,yet it covers some of the most exciting snd relevant topics in the industry.</p><br>
    </ul>
        <p><img src ="developersunited.jpg"></p>
       <aside>
        <p>Throughout the course we cover tons of tools and technologies including: </p>
        <img src ="development-courses.jpg">
        <ul>
        <li><span>HTML5</span></li><br>
        <li><span>CSS3</span></li><br>
        <li><span>JavaScript</span></li><br>
        <li>DOM Manipulation</li><br>
        <li><span>jQuery</span></li><br>
        <li><span>NodeJS</span></li><br>
        <li>NPM</li><br>
        <li><span>ExpressJS</span></li><br>
        <li><span>MongoDB</span></li><br>
        <li>Database Associations</li><br>
        <li><span>Authentication</span></li><br>
        <li>Authorization</li><br>
        </ul><br>    
        </aside>
    <p>This course is also unique in the way that it is structured and presented. Many online courses are just a long series of "watch as I code" videos. This course is different. I've incorporated everything I learned in my years of teaching to make this course not only more effective but more engaging. The course includes:</p>
        <ul>
        <li> Lectures</li><br>
        <li> Code-Alongs</li><br>
        <li> Exercises</li><br>
        <li> Projects</li><br>
        <li> Research Assignments</li><br>
        <li> Slides</li><br>
        <li> Downloads</li><br>
        <li> Readings</li><br>
</ul>
